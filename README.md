## TASK DESCRIPTION

This project is a simple Java utility that performs basic file handling operations: writing to a file, reading from a file, and modifying its contents.

The program starts by writing sample content into a file named `example.txt` using `BufferedWriter`. It then reads the file line by line using `BufferedReader` to display the existing content. To demonstrate modification, it replaces a specified word in the file using string replacement methods, and writes the updated content back to the same file using `Files.write()`.

The project uses standard Java I/O classes including `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, and the `java.nio.file` package. Exception handling is implemented to manage potential I/O errors during execution.

This utility is a demonstration of how basic file operations can be implemented using core Java libraries, with clean code structure and inline comments for clarity.
