## TASK DESCRIPTION

The "File Handling Utility" is a Java-based project developed as part of the CODTECH internship under the Front-End Development domain. This task aims to demonstrate fundamental file operations in Java — specifically, reading, writing, and modifying text files.

File handling is a critical aspect of software development, commonly used for managing configurations, storing logs, and handling user-generated content. In this project, Java’s built-in I/O (Input/Output) classes such as `FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, and `Files` are utilized to perform operations on a file named `example.txt`.

The program is structured in three parts. First, it writes predefined content into a text file, showcasing the ability to create and write to files using `FileWriter`. Next, it reads the file content line by line using `BufferedReader`, which highlights how data can be retrieved and processed. Finally, the program performs content modification by replacing a specific string using `Files.readAllBytes` and `String.replace()`, and then overwrites the modified content back into the file.

The code is written with proper comments and follows clean coding practices to ensure readability and maintainability. Exception handling is used effectively to catch and handle any potential I/O errors, improving the reliability of the program.

By completing this task, the intern gains hands-on experience with essential Java programming techniques. It also reinforces understanding of text processing, file stream management, and basic exception handling — which are key competencies in both front-end and full-stack development roles.

This task not only builds technical proficiency but also encourages the habit of writing clean, well-documented code — a critical skill in real-world software projects. Mastery of file handling also sets the foundation for working with structured data formats like CSV, JSON, or XML in future applications.

Overall, this project successfully fulfills the objectives of the internship module by integrating theoretical learning with practical application, helping interns develop a strong foundation in core programming concepts.
